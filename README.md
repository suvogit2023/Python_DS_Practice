# Python_DS_Practice
This GitHub repository includes code snippets inspired by Prateek Guptaâ€™s book, "Practical Data Science with Jupyter". I have used this book extensively as a reference to deepen my understanding of Data Science concepts and to practice Python programming. Certain code snippets may closely resemble or directly replicate those in the book to support my learning.

All intellectual property rights for the original content belong to Prateek Gupta. If any code in this repository appears similar or identical to that in the book, it is purely for educational purposes. My intent in sharing this code on GitHub is solely to showcase my Python skills and understanding of Data Science principles, without any commercial, business, or profit-related motive. For a more comprehensive understanding and complete insights, please consult the original book.
